What Happens in pred = model(X)?
Forward Propagation:

The input data X (e.g., images or feature vectors) is passed through the model.
The model is defined earlier (e.g., NeuralNetwork) and contains layers like Flatten, Linear, and activation functions (ReLU).
The input tensor flows through these layers sequentially, and the model computes the output predictions for each sample in X.
pred:

pred is the raw output (logits) produced by the model. These logits are not yet probabilities but are scores indicating how likely each class is for each input sample.
For example:

If the batch size is 64 and there are 10 classes, pred will have the shape [64, 10].
Each row corresponds to a sample in the batch, and each column corresponds to a class.

Why Use model.eval() Before This?
The model is set to evaluation mode using model.eval() before the test loop.
Purpose:
Disables behaviors specific to training (e.g., dropout, batch normalization updates) to ensure consistent and accurate results during testing.
